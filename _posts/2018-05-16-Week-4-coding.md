    <td>I learn't by going through the exercises as I have done every time and if I got stuck I would try again and persevere  till  I got it right if this didnâ€™t work I  would ask my partner. This has never not worked which is why I have done it every week.</td>

    <td>I think that I worked efficiently as I could but what I should do is change my mindset to think that I can work faster than I actually can so there is a small chance that I will work quicker.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I already think that I am working through the program as best as I can taking all the information that it has to other and I think If I worked any quicker I would get stuck and immediately ask for help rather than thinking it through.</td>
