    <td>Although I was trying my best to work quickly I did not complete my target of one stage as I was talking a bit to much and the stage had 19 parts so a it took a long time to complete.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will not talk at all unless I really need help and then I will talk to my partner as he has done so he will know how to completed this should make complete parts of a stage faster so I will complete my target.</td>
