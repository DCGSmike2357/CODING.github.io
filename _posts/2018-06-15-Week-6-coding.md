    <td>This as with many other weeks I found that the most effective strategy was to try my hardest to the task set on my own And when couldn't do it press the help button and if that didn’t work talk the question through with my partner.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think I could more done in the lesson by setting my target to more than just one stage but because this lesson I just completed that one stage and then didn’t as hard as I was working before this means I could be getting more done in lesson if I set my goal higher.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will set my target to one a half stages so that I get more done even if i don’t target I will still work faster and more efficiently. Also at the beginning of the lesson I will start straight away to maximise the time I spend on code academy.</td>
