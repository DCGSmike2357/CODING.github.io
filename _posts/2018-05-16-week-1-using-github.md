  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by going through each stages of the code academy python learning part. I would read the examples and then see what it asked me to do so I would then complete the task. I found that reading the examples made the task quite easier.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I got half of my target I think that I need to work faster or do some more work on it at home as I think I was working quite efficiently in the lesson. Also I think that I talked to person next to me too much.</td>

    <td>Next time I will work more efficiently in the lesson and I will do little bit coding most days as I do enjoy the work we are doing.</td>
