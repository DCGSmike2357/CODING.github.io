    <td>This week I found the most effective strategy for me is to make I read all of the info bit at the of each stage because this is very useful if you get stuck at a later point in the stage. If that doesn't work you can press the hint button.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to make sure that I donâ€™t talk to my partner about other things than the work as this is distracting and wastes time but it very useful to talk to my partner if I get stuck. As my parnter is amazing at coding.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will persevere to and not talk partner so I will work much quicker this means that I will get more done next time and therefore I will get better at coding. Also I will not sit on a question for ages I ask partner and use the hint/solution button. </td>
